Objective: Convert the provided diagram or image into a structured workflow using a Finite-State Machine (FSM) model. The FSM represents the workflow as a directed graph where states are nodes, and transitions are edges between them.

Each state, except for the initial state ("None"), should be reachable via at least one transition, ensuring that no states are isolated. Every transition must connect a valid start state to an end state.

Additionally, if the user specifies criteria or processes related to any transitions, they must be included. If it's logically obvious that criteria or processes should exist (e.g., when multiple transitions leave the same state), add them accordingly.

Requirements:

The FSM begins with an initial state labeled "None" as the origin.
Define transitions between states, ensuring each state (except "None") is the target of at least one transition.
Ensure all states (except "None") are reachable from another state, making the workflow fully connected.

Graph Theory Concepts Applied:

Nodes (States): Represent the different stages in the workflow.
Edges (Transitions): Directed transitions from one state to another.
Connectivity: All states (except the initial state) must have at least one incoming transition to ensure a fully connected workflow, without isolated states.
