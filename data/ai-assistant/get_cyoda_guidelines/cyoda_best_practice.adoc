= Cyoda Best Practice Guidelines: Entity-Centric, Workflow-Driven Systems

== 1. What Is an Entity?

At the heart of Cyoda's architecture is the *Entity*: a domain object that represents a real-world "thing" with evolving state over time — such as a customer, a transaction, or a risk case.

*Key principles of entities:*
- *Persistent*: An entity has a life span. It exists independently of transient system behavior.

- *Structured State*: It evolves through a defined set of states.

- *Contextualized*: Its current state reflects its full operational context.

In Cyoda, *every problem is approached as an entity problem*, meaning the system's purpose is to create, observe, evolve, and act upon entities in meaningful ways.

== 2. Why Entities Are Key in Cyoda

Cyoda is not just a data platform — it's a *process platform*. Entities serve as the unifying structure for:

- *Data*: facts about the world

- *State*: where things stand now

- *Behavior*: how things change

This approach allows Cyoda systems to be:
- *Decoupled*: Business logic is localized within entities

- *Composable*: Entities can reference or trigger one another

- *Auditable*: Every state change is captured and traceable

== 3. What Is a Workflow?

A *workflow* is the behavioral model of an entity, often represented as a *finite-state machine (FSM)*. It defines:

- *States*: Possible statuses of the entity

- *Transitions*: Changes from one state to another

- *Triggers and Processes*: Events causing transitions, and logic that runs during them


Workflows define *how business logic unfolds over time* in a structured, visual, and deterministic way.

== 4. Role of Event-Driven Architecture

In Cyoda’s event-driven model:
- *Events* (e.g. "document uploaded") trigger entity transitions

- Transitions invoke *processes* (e.g. business rules, messaging)

- Everything is tied together via the entity’s *workflow*

*Advantages:*
- *Loose coupling*

- *Responsiveness*

- *Scalability*

== 5. Putting It All Together in Cyoda

The Cyoda method:
- Model your domain as an *entity*

- Define its behavior in a *workflow*

- Let *events* drive change

- Store everything in the *entity database* — data, state, and process

== 6. Guiding Practices

- Always think in terms of *stateful entities*

- Prefer *FSM workflows* over procedural code

- Use *event triggers* for process logic

- Keep *rules* close to the entity

- *Visualize workflows* for stakeholder alignment
