= Registering Workflow Externalized Processors

After defining your entities and workflows, you can implement *externalized processors* to handle automated transition logic.

== 1. Overview

An *externalized processor* is a function that is:
- Triggered by the Cyoda gRPC server when a specific workflow transition occurs

- Responsible for modifying and returning the updated entity

- Automatically persisted — no need to call the entity service

== 2. How It Works

. Your application comes preconfigured with a *gRPC client* (in the `commons` module)

. A *bi-directional streaming connection* is established with your Cyoda environment

. When a transition is triggered that has an external processor defined, you receive a calculation request

. The request contains the *entity data*

. The corresponding function is *dispatched* by the workflow dispatcher

. You perform your logic and *return the updated entity*


== 3. Where to Define Your Processor

Locate the following file in your project:
[source,shell]
----
entity/<your_entity_name>/workflow/workflow.py
----

== 4. Define the Processor Function

Create a function whose name matches the one specified in your workflow JSON under `externalized_processors`.

Example JSON snippet:
[source,json]
----
"externalized_processors": [
  {
    "name": "process_set_booked_at",
    "description": ""
  }
]
----

Example function in Python:
[source,python]
----
def process_set_booked_at(entity):
    # Set the booking timestamp on the entity
    entity["booked_at"] = time.time()
    return entity
----

== 5. Notes

- The function receives the entity as a Python dictionary

- It should return the updated entity

- No explicit persistence is needed — the gRPC server handles that

== Summary

[horizontal]
Trigger → Workflow transition with external processor  
Location → `entity/<name>/workflow/workflow.py`  
Naming → Must match `process_<transition_name>`  
Input → Entity dict  
Output → Modified entity  
Persistence → Done by gRPC server
