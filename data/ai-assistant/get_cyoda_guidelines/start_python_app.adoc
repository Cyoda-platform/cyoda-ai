= Starting the Application and Validating the Prototype

== First Prototype Ready for Validation

We have completed the first prototype based on your functional requirements.

Follow the instructions below to start the application, validate the API, and observe workflow processor behavior.

== 1. Run the Application

To launch the app, run:

[source,python]
----
python app.py
----

This starts the local HTTP API server and also initializes the gRPC client for receiving workflow calculation requests.

== 2. Validate the API

Once the app is running, open your browser and go to:

- http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)

- http://localhost:8000/scalar (Scalar schema viewer)


You can find request and response examples in:

[source,shell]
----
entity/functional_requirement.md
----

== 3. Observe Workflow Behavior

- When you save data to an entity (e.g., through the API), its workflow will automatically be triggered.

- If the workflow transition includes an *externalized processor*, the system will:
  * Send a *calculation request* to your app via gRPC

  * Dispatch the corresponding processor function (from `workflow.py`)

  * Automatically persist the updated entity

== Summary
