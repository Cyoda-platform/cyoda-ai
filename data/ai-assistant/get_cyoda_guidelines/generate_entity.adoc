= Adding an Entity Model in Your Project

To define a new entity in your project, follow these steps:

== 1. Locate the `entity` Directory

Navigate to the root of your project and find the `entity/` directory.

== 2. Create a Directory for Your Entity

Create a new subdirectory inside `entity/` with the name of your entity.  
Example:
[source,shell]
----
mkdir entity/customer
----

== 3. Add a JSON Data Model

Inside the new entity directory, create a `.json` file that describes the entity's data model.  
Example path:
[source,shell]
----
entity/customer/customer.json
----

This file should define the fields and structure for your entity.

== 4. Automatic Registration

Your entity will be *automatically registered* in the system when you first add data for it. No manual registration is required.

== 5. Optional: Add Static Code Representation

You may optionally define the same model using code:
- *Python*: Add a `pydantic` model
- *Java*: Add a POJO (Plain Old Java Object)

This can be useful for validation, IDE support, and integration.

== Summary

[horizontal]
Directory → `entity/<entity_name>/`  
Model File → `*.json` (describes the schema)  
Optional Code → Pydantic / POJO  
Registration → Automatic on first data addition
