Data Ingestion Job (data_ingestion_job)\n```json\n{\n  \"entity_name\": \"data_ingestion_job\",\n  \"entity_type\": \"JOB\",\n  \"entity_source\": \"API_REQUEST\",\n  \"workflow_trigger\": \"scheduled ingestion of cover photos\",\n  \"data_ingestion_time\": \"2020-01-01\",\n  \"data_ingestion_id\": \"123\",\n  \"status\": \"success\"\n}\n```\n- **Description**: This job is responsible for orchestrating the process of retrieving cover photos from the specified API.\n### 2. Raw Data Entity (raw_data_entity)\n```json\n{\n  \"entity_name\": \"raw_data_entity\",\n  \"entity_type\": \"EXTERNAL_SOURCES_PULL_BASED_RAW_DATA\",\n  \"entity_source\": \"ENTITY_EVENT\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"url\": \"https://example.com/cover_photo1.jpg\",\n      \"description\": \"Cover photo for the first book.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2,\n      \"url\": \"https://example.com/cover_photo2.jpg\",\n      \"description\": \"Cover photo for the second book.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n- **Description**: This entity stores the data retrieved from the Cover Photos API, including details of the cover photos.\n### 3. Report Entity (report_entity)\n```json\n{\n  \"entity_name\": \"report_entity\",\n  \"entity_type\": \"SECONDARY_DATA\",\n  \"entity_source\": \"ENTITY_EVENT\",\n  \"report\": {\n    \"title\": \"Daily Cover Photo Report\",\n    \"date_generated\": \"2023-10-10\",\n    \"summary\": \"This report contains the details of the cover photos ingested from the API.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n- **Description**: This report entity is created after the data ingestion process, summarizing the details of the cover photos collected.\n## Workflow Overview\n### Workflow Flowchart\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start State] -->|transition: ingest_cover_photos, processor: schedule_ingestion, processor attributes: sync_process=false| B[Raw Data Entity Created]\n  B -->|transition: generate_report, processor: generate_report, processor attributes: sync_process=true| D[Report Entity Created]\n  D --> F[End State]\n```\n### Workflow Description\n- The workflow initiates the data ingestion process by triggering the `data_ingestion_job`.\n- Upon successful ingestion of data, the raw data entity is created.\n- Finally, the workflow generates a report summarizing the ingested data and creates the report entity.\n## Event-Driven Architecture\nThe application employs an event-driven architecture that enables it to respond automatically to various triggers without manual intervention. Key events include:\n1. **Data Ingestion**: Triggered by the scheduled job to fetch cover photos from the API.\n2. **Data Processing**: Events that facilitate the transition from raw data to aggregated data and report generation.\n## Conclusion\nThe PRD outlines the essential components and functionalities required for the application focused on ingesting, aggregating, and reporting cover photos from an API. By leveraging an event-driven architecture, the application ensures efficient and automated processing of data, ultimately enhancing the user experience for the admin receiving the reports.\nIf you have any further adjustments or additional requirements, please let me know!
