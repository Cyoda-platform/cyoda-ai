This document will include:\n1. **User Stories**: Descriptions of what users want to achieve with the application.\n2. **Journey Diagram**: A visual representation of the user's journey through the application.\n3. **Sequence Diagram**: A detailed diagram showing the interactions between different components during the data ingestion and reporting process.\n\n### User Requirement Document\n\n#### User Stories\n```markdown\n## User Stories\n\n- **User Story 1**: As a user, I want to ingest data from the specified API so that I can collect information about cover photos.\n- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to enrich the retrieved data with additional details for each cover photo, ensuring I have comprehensive information.\n- **User Story 3**: As a user, I want the application to generate a report based on the aggregated data so that I can review the information collected.\n- **User Story 4**: As an admin, I want to receive the generated report via email, allowing me to stay updated without logging into the system.\n```\n\n#### Journey Diagram\n```mermaid\njourney\n    title User Journey for Cover Photo Ingestion\n    section Start\n      User initiates data ingestion: 5: User\n    section Ingestion Process\n      User requests cover photos from API: 5: User\n      API retrieves list of cover photos: 5: API\n      Data ingestion process triggers: 5: Data_ingestion\n    section Enrichment Process\n      Enrichment API is called for each photo ID: 5: Cover_photos_api\n      Detailed information is retrieved for each photo: 5: API\n    section Reporting\n      Report generation is triggered based on ingested data: 5: Report\n      Admin receives the report via email: 5: Admin\n```\n\n#### Sequence Diagram\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Data_ingestion\n    participant Cover_photos_api\n    participant Report\n    participant API\n    \n    User->>API: Request to list cover photos\n    API->>Data_ingestion: Initiate data ingestion\n    Data_ingestion->>API: Retrieve ID for cover photos\n    API->>Cover_photos_api: Fetch details for each ID\n    Cover_photos_api->>API: Return details for cover photos\n    API->>Report: Generate report with ingested data\n```\n\n### Explanation of Choices:\n- **User Stories**: These capture the specific goals of users, helping us understand their needs and prioritize features for the application.\n- **Journey Diagram**: This diagram visually represents the steps a user takes in the application, highlighting key interactions and processes. It helps in identifying potential pain points or areas for improvement.\n- **Sequence Diagram**: This diagram provides a detailed view of the interactions between different components in the system during the data ingestion and reporting process. It helps in understanding the flow of information and ensuring that all necessary steps are accounted for.\n\nIf you have any additional details or specific expectations you'd like to include, please let me know! I'm here to help you refine this further and ensure it meets your needs. \ud83c\udf1f"}]}
