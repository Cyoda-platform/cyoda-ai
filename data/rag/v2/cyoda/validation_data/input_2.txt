Include all the necessary details specified by the user."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Detailed Summary of User Requirement\n\nThe user has expressed a need to develop an application focused on the efficient management and enrichment of book data through an API-driven process. Below are the comprehensive details of the user requirements:\n\n### 1. Application Purpose\n- The core functionality of the application is to **fetch a list of books** from a specified API and enrich the response data by **adding cover photos** for each book.\n\n### 2. Data Sources\n- **Primary Data Source**: The application will retrieve book data through an **API call**. This data will include essential information such as the title, author, description, and other relevant attributes of each book.\n- **Secondary Data Source**: To enrich the book information, the application will make **another API call** to fetch the cover photo for each book. The cover photo can be obtained by providing the **book's ID**.\n\n### 3. Data Management\n- The application should manage the data efficiently by:\n  - **Storing the raw data** of books received from the first API call.\n  - **Enriching** the stored book data by appending the cover photo information fetched from the secondary API.\n\n### 4. Enrichment Process\n- The enrichment process should be seamless, ensuring that the cover photos are accurately associated with their respective books. This indicates an **integration mechanism** that connects the book data with its cover images based on the provided book IDs.\n\n### 5. Focus on Book Entities\n- The user specifies that the primary focus of the application is to manage and enrich the **book entities**. This includes both the initial book data and the enriched data with the cover photos.\n\n### 6. Workflow and Processing\n- The user expects the application to orchestrate the **data ingestion via a job** mechanism, where:\n  - The ingestion job will handle the fetching of book data from the API.\n  - The system will trigger the saving of book entities accordingly.\n \n### 7. Implementation Considerations\n- The user has not specified particular technologies or frameworks for implementation, providing flexibility in choosing the appropriate tech stack.\n- The application should ensure proper error handling during API calls to manage potential failures gracefully.\n\n### 8. Automation\n- The process should be designed to operate efficiently, minimizing manual intervention during the data ingestion and enrichment phases.\n\n### Overall Goal\nThe overall objective of the application is to provide a streamlined solution for fetching and enriching book data, ensuring that users can access comprehensive and visually rich information about the books available through the API."}]}
