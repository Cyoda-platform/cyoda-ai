Got it! You want me to validate your requirement for the "Hello World" app and return a user requirement document that includes user stories, a journey diagram, and a sequence diagram. Sounds great!

### User Requirement Document

#### User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to send a GET request with my name so that I can receive a personalized greeting.
2. **As a user**, I want to receive an error message if I forget to include my name in the request, so I know what to do next.

#### Journey Diagram

```mermaid
journey
    title User Journey for Hello World App
    section Start
      User opens the app: 5: User
    section Sending Request
      User sends /hello/$name GET: 5: User
      User fails to send a name: 3: User
    section Receiving Response
      App responds with "hello, $name": 5: App
      App responds with error message: 3: App
```

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant HelloWorldApp

    User->>HelloWorldApp: GET /hello/$name
    HelloWorldApp-->>User: "hello, $name"
    
    User->>HelloWorldApp: GET /hello/
    HelloWorldApp-->>User: "Error: Name required"
```

### Explanation

- **User Stories**: I included these to capture what the user wants to achieve in a simple, relatable way. It keeps the focus on the end-user experience!
  
- **Journey Diagram**: This diagram shows the different steps a user goes through while interacting with the app. It highlights the happy path (sending the name and getting a greeting) and the error scenario, giving a clear view of the user experience.

- **Sequence Diagram**: This diagram illustrates the interaction between the user and the app. It shows how the GET request is handled and what responses are sent back, making it easy to understand the flow.
