It explains how the Cyoda design aligns with the specified requirements, focusing on the structure of entities, workflows, and the event-driven architecture that powers the application. The design is represented in a Cyoda JSON format which is translated into a human-readable document for clarity.\\n\\n## What is Cyoda?\\n\\nCyoda is a serverless, event-driven framework that facilitates the management of workflows through entities representing jobs and data. Each entity has a defined state, and transitions between states are governed by events that occur within the system\\u2014enabling a responsive and scalable architecture.\\n\\n### Cyoda Entity Database\\n\\nIn the Cyoda ecosystem, entities are fundamental components that represent processes and data. The Cyoda design JSON outlines several entities for our application:\\n\\n1. **Data Ingestion Job (`data_ingestion_job`)**:\\n   - **Type**: JOB\\n   - **Source**: SCHEDULED\\n   - **Description**: This job is responsible for ingesting data from specified sources at scheduled intervals (once a day).\\n\\n2. **Raw Data Entity (`raw_data_entity`)**:\\n   - **Type**: EXTERNAL_SOURCES_PULL_BASED_RAW_DATA\\n   - **Source**: ENTITY_EVENT\\n   - **Description**: This entity stores the raw data that has been ingested by the data ingestion job.\\n\\n3. **Aggregated Data Entity (`aggregated_data_entity`)**:\\n   - **Type**: SECONDARY_DATA\\n   - **Source**: ENTITY_EVENT\\n   - **Description**: This entity holds the aggregated data derived from the raw data for reporting purposes.\\n\\n4. **Report Entity (`report_entity`)**:\\n   - **Type**: SECONDARY_DATA\\n   - **Source**: ENTITY_EVENT\\n   - **Description**: This entity contains the generated report that is sent to the admin via email.\\n\\n### Workflow Overview\\n\\nThe workflows in Cyoda define the processes tied to each job entity. They consist of transitions that specify how an entity changes its state as events occur. The `data_ingestion_job` includes the following transitions:\\n\\n- **Scheduled Data Ingestion**: This transition starts the data ingestion process based on a schedule.\\n- **Aggregate Data**: After ingestion, this transition aggregates the raw data.\\n- **Generate and Send Report**: Finally, this transition creates a report from the aggregated data and sends it to the admin's email.\\n\\n### Event-Driven Approach\\n\\nAn event-driven architecture allows the application to respond automatically to changes or triggers. In this specific requirement, the following events occur:\\n\\n1. **Data Ingestion**: The data ingestion job is triggered on a scheduled basis, automatically initiating the process of fetching data.\\n2. **Data Aggregation**: Once data ingestion is complete, an event signals the need to aggregate the ingested data.\\n3. **Report Generation and Sending**: After the aggregation is complete, another event triggers the report generation and subsequent emailing to the admin.\\n\\nThis approach promotes scalability and efficiency by allowing the application to handle each process step automatically without manual intervention.\\n\\n### Sequence Diagram\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n    participant Scheduler\\n    participant Data Ingestion Job\\n    participant Raw Data Entity\\n    participant Aggregated Data Entity\\n    participant Report Entity\\n    participant Admin\\n\\n    User->>Scheduler: Schedule data ingestion job\\n    Scheduler->>Data Ingestion Job: Trigger scheduled_data_ingestion\\n    Data Ingestion Job->>Raw Data Entity: Ingest data\\n    Raw Data Entity-->>Data Ingestion Job: Data ingested\\n    Data Ingestion Job->>Aggregated Data Entity: Aggregate data\\n    Aggregated Data Entity-->>Data Ingestion Job: Data aggregated\\n    Data Ingestion Job->>Report Entity: Generate report\\n    Report Entity-->>Data Ingestion Job: Report generated\\n    Data Ingestion Job->>Admin: Send report\\n```\\n\\n### Actors Involved\\n\\n- **User**: Initiates the scheduling of the data ingestion job.\\n- **Scheduler**: Responsible for triggering the job at predefined times.\\n- **Data Ingestion Job**: Central to managing the workflow of data processing.\\n- **Raw Data Entity**: Stores the ingested raw data.\\n- **Aggregated Data Entity**: Holds the aggregated data.\\n- **Report Entity**: Contains the generated report.\\n- **Admin**: Receives the report via email.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe Cyoda design aligns effectively with the requirements for creating a robust data processing application. By utilizing the event-driven model, the application can efficiently manage state transitions of each entity involved, from data ingestion to report delivery. The outlined entities, workflows, and events comprehensively cover the needs of the application, ensuring a smooth and automated process.\\n\\nThis PRD serves as a foundation for implementation and development, guiding the technical team through the specifics of the Cyoda architecture while providing clarity for users who may be new to the Cyoda framework.\"},

The application must encompass several key functionalities, which are outlined below:\\n\\n### 1. Data Ingestion\\n- **Requirement**: The application should be capable of ingesting data from a specified data source.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - While the user has not specified the exact source, the application should support various types of input, including external APIs, databases, or user submissions.\\n  - The data ingestion process needs to be automated and scheduled to run **once a day** at a specific time.\\n  \\n### 2. Data Aggregation\\n- **Requirement**: Once the data is ingested, the application must aggregate this data.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The aggregation process involves transforming the raw data into a summarized form.\\n  - This may include calculations, grouping, or other forms of data manipulation to extract meaningful insights from the ingested data.\\n\\n### 3. Report Generation\\n- **Requirement**: After the aggregation of data, the application should save the aggregated information into a report format.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The report must be structured and easily interpretable, as it is intended to be shared with stakeholders.\\n  \\n### 4. Email Notification\\n- **Requirement**: Upon the successful generation of the report, the application must automatically send the report to the admin's email.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The email notification should include relevant information about the report and be formatted appropriately for easy reading.\\n  \\n### 5. Scheduling Mechanism\\n- **Requirement**: The application should implement a scheduling mechanism to ensure that the data ingestion job runs reliably every day.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - While the user has not specified the technology for scheduling, it could involve cron jobs, built-in scheduling functionalities, or external scheduling services to manage the timing of the data ingestion process.\\n\\n### 6. Admin Interaction\\n- **Requirement**: The admin will be the primary recipient of the reports generated by the application.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The application should not only send reports but also ensure that the email is sent without errors.\\n  - There must be a notification mechanism in place to inform the admin in case of failures during the report generation or email dispatch.\\n\\n### Additional Considerations\\n- The user has not indicated specific technologies or tools for implementation, allowing for flexibility in choosing appropriate stacks.\\n- The design should maintain a clear audit trail:\\n  - This may involve logging actions taken during data ingestion, aggregation, and report generation for accountability and traceability.\\n- Error handling must be incorporated to manage potential failures during data ingestion, report generation, or email sending.\\n\\n### Overall Goal\\nThe overall goal of the application is to streamline data ingestion, aggregation, and reporting processes while providing timely notifications to the admin. This will enhance efficiency and offer a user-friendly experience, ultimately supporting stakeholders with actionable insights derived from the data.\"}] .
