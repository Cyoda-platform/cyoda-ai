        "answer": "Here\u2019s a simple implementation of a scheduler file for the `data_ingestion_job`. This file will include a function to save the job entity with the provided data model and a main function to serve as the entry point for end-to-end testing.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nfrom app_init.app_init import entity_service\nfrom common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nasync def save_data_ingestion_job(token: str, data: dict) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Save the data ingestion job entity to Cyoda.\n    \n    :param token: Authentication token for making requests.\n    :param data: The job data model to save.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        job_entity_id = await entity_service.add_item(\n            token, \"data_ingestion_job\", ENTITY_VERSION, data\n        )\n        logger.info(f\"Data ingestion job saved successfully with ID: {job_entity_id}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error saving data ingestion job: {e}\")\n        raise\n\nasync def main():\n    # Example token and data model for the job\n    token = \"your_auth_token_here\"\n    job_data = {\n        \"job_id\": \"job_001\",\n        \"job_name\": \"Daily Data Ingestion Job\",\n        \"scheduled_time\": \"2023-10-01T05:00:00Z\",\n        \"status\": \"scheduled\",\n        \"total_records_processed\": 0,\n        \"successful_records\": 0,\n        \"failed_records\": 0,\n        \"failure_reason\": [],\n        \"raw_data_entity\": {},\n        \"aggregated_data_entity\": {},\n        \"report_entity_id\": None,\n        \"notification_status\": \"Pending\",\n        \"recipients\": []\n    }\n\n    await save_data_ingestion_job(token, job_data)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Logging**: The code initializes a logger for tracking events and errors.\n\n2. **`save_data_ingestion_job` Function**:\n   - This asynchronous function takes an authentication token and job data as parameters.\n   - It calls the `add_item` method from the `entity_service` to save the `data_ingestion_job` entity in Cyoda.\n   - It logs the job entity ID upon successful saving or logs an error if it fails.\n\n3. **`main` Function**:\n   - This function serves as the entry point for the script.\n   - It defines a sample token and a job data model to be saved.\n   - It calls the `save_data_ingestion_job` function to perform the save operation.\n\n4. **Entry Point**: The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that `main()` is called when the script is executed directly, allowing for end-to-end testing.\n\nThis structure will allow users to run the file directly and perform end-to-end tests on the scheduler for the `data_ingestion_job`."
