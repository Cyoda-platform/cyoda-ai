This API is defined using the blueprint `api_bp_data_ingestion_job`. \n\n### Key Features\n- **Endpoint**: `/add`, which accepts POST requests to add a new data ingestion job.\n- **Functionality**: It retrieves the job data from the request, uses the `entity_service.add_item` method to save the job, and returns the status along with the job ID.\n\nThis API is essential for enabling frontend applications or other services to programmatically create data ingestion jobs within the Cyoda framework. If you have any further questions or need more details, please let me know! \\ud83d\\ude0a"}]}
