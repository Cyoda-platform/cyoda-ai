{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a cyoda application builder assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Could you please explain what processors functions you wrote. Explain that they are isolated functions in a faas way like aws lambda. They will be triggered by Cyoda grpc server when the authors_entity entity state changes. Tell what tests you wrote and how you mocked Cyoda entity service (repository) so that i can test every function in an isolated fashion. Also please answer my questions if I have any.  Your answer should be well-structured with markdown and not exceed 100 words. I say: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have implemented two processor functions: **`retrieve_authors_process`** and **`process_authors_data`**. These isolated functions operate similarly to AWS Lambda, executing specific tasks in response to events. They will be triggered by the Cyoda gRPC server when the `authors_entity` state changes.\n\nThe tests validate these functions by mocking the Cyoda entity service, ensuring that data is saved correctly without relying on the actual repository. This allows for isolated testing of functionality. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know!"}]}
