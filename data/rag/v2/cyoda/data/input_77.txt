Also please answer my questions if I have any. Your answer should be well-structured with markdown and not exceed 100 words. I say: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I added a new Quart API for the **`user_interface_entity`** to handle the saving of data related to user interactions with the application. This API endpoint (`/save`) processes POST requests containing input fields, display sections, error messages, user actions, and workflow integration details. Upon receiving the request, the API constructs the user interface entity and saves it using the entity service. This functionality is essential for tracking and managing user interactions, ensuring the application can effectively respond to user requests for conversion rates and related data. If you have any questions or need further information, please let me know!"}]}
