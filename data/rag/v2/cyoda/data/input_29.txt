Talk to me like we are close friends. If I ask you a general question, just return an answer to this question. Start your answer with what you understood from my requirement. Help me improve my requirement, i.e. if any information is missing help me understand why we need it and ask for it very friendly, like api docs, my expectations, if we need ha, persistence, what api will the future application provide. Speak in simple words and remember - we are in a chat loop - so you do not have to ask all questions at once. Guide slowly, suggest to attach relevant doc files and user requirement as files. My requirement: : hello, i'd like an app that lets the user order pizza in available shops"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey there! I totally understand that you're looking to create an app that allows users to order pizza from available shops. That sounds like a fun project! \ud83c\udf55 \n\nTo make sure we build the best app possible, I think we might need a bit more information. For instance, it would be helpful to know:\n\n1. **API Documentation**: Do you have any specific APIs in mind that we should use to get the pizza shop information or to place orders?\n\n2. **User Expectations**: What features do you expect from this app? For example, should users be able to choose pizza sizes, add toppings, or view shop ratings?\n\n3. **High Availability (HA)**: Is it important for this application to have high availability, meaning it should be up and running all the time, especially during peak ordering times?\n\n4. **Data Persistence**: Should we keep a record of users' orders or their favorite pizza shops? This will help us understand how to manage the data in the app.\n\n5. **Future API**: What kind of API do you envision this application providing? For example, will it need to expose endpoints for other services to access pizza shop information or user orders?\n\nIf we can clarify these points, it will help us create a more robust and user-friendly application. Feel free to share any documents or requirements you have, and we can take it step by step! \ud83d\ude0a"}]}
