This document will include user stories, a journey diagram, and a sequence diagram, all presented in Markdown format using the mermaid dialect for visual representations.\\### **User Requirement Document**\\#### **Overview**\\The application aims to provide users with real-time conversion rates for Bitcoin against various currencies. It will connect to external APIs to fetch the latest rates, process the data, and present it in a user-friendly interface.\\#### **User Stories**\\1. **As a User,** I want to input the amount of Bitcoin I want to convert, so that I can see how much it is worth in my preferred currency.\\2. **As a User,** I want to select multiple currencies for conversion, so that I can compare rates across different currencies like USD, EUR, and GBP.\\3. **As a User,** I want to view my historical conversion requests, so that I can track past queries and conversion rates.\\4. **As a User,** I want to receive notifications if there is an error retrieving data from the API, so that I know to try again later or check my internet connection.\\#### **User Journey Diagram**\\```mermaid\\journey\\title User Journey for Bitcoin Conversion Application\\section Start\\User opens the app: 5: User\\section Request Conversion Rates\\User enters Bitcoin amount: 5: User\\User selects currency (USD, EUR, etc.): 5: User\\System sends request to Conversion Rate API: 4: System\\System receives conversion rates: 5: System\\System processes data and displays result: 5: System\\User views conversion rate result: 5: User\\section View Historical Rates\\User clicks on \"View History\": 5: User\\System fetches historical data: 4: System\\System displays historical conversion rates: 5: System\\User views historical data: 5: User\\section Error Handling\\API fails to return data: 1: System\\System shows error message: 5: System\\User retries or refreshes: 5: User\\```\\#### **Sequence Diagram**\\```mermaid\\sequenceDiagram\\participant User\\participant UI\\participant Data Processor\\participant Conversion Rate API\\participant Historical Data Storage\\User->>UI: Opens application\\UI->>User: Displays input fields\\User->>UI: Inputs Bitcoin amount and selects currency\\UI->>Data Processor: Sends request for conversion rate\\Data Processor->>Conversion Rate API: Fetches latest rates\\Conversion Rate API-->>Data Processor: Returns conversion rates\\Data Processor->>UI: Sends processed data\\UI->>User: Displays conversion rate\\User->>UI: Requests to view historical data\\UI->>Historical Data Storage: Retrieves past conversion requests\\Historical Data Storage-->>UI: Sends historical data\\UI->>User: Displays historical conversion rates\\```\\### **Explanation of Choices**\\- **User Stories**: These capture the specific needs and expectations of the user, ensuring that the application is designed with the end-user in mind.\\- **Journey Diagram**: This visual representation illustrates the steps the user takes when interacting with the application, highlighting the key actions and system responses.\\- **Sequence Diagram**: This diagram outlines the flow of information between different components of the system, demonstrating how the application processes user requests and retrieves data from external APIs.\\By organizing the requirement in this manner, we can ensure that the development team has a clear understanding of the user\\'s needs and the interactions necessary to fulfill those needs.
