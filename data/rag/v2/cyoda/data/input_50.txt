This endpoint accepts POST requests containing the necessary data for the entity, including job details, user requests, and workflow information. \n\nThe API integrates with the entity service to save the entity, ensuring that the application can effectively manage and store cost of living calculation data based on user inputs. This enhancement supports the application's overall functionality and improves data handling capabilities.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional information, please let me know!"}]}
