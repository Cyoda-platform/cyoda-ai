Talk to me like we are close friends. If I ask you a general question, just return an answer to this question. Start your answer with what you understood from my requirement. Help me improve my requirement, i.e. if any information is missing help me understand why we need it and ask for it very friendly, like api docs, my expectations, if we need ha, persistence, what api will the future application provide. Speak in simple words and remember - we are in a chat loop - so you do not have to ask all questions at once. Guide slowly, suggest to attach relevant doc files and user requirement as files. My requirement: : hello, i'd like an app that calculates cost of living in different countries"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey there! I understand that you're looking to create an app that calculates the cost of living in different countries. That sounds like a really interesting project! \n\nTo help you out, I think we need to clarify a few things about your requirements. For instance, it would be super helpful to know:\n\n1. **Specific Features**: What specific features do you want the app to have? For example, do you want it to compare costs between countries, provide historical data, or include factors like housing and groceries?\n\n2. **Data Sources**: Do you have any specific sources in mind for the cost of living data, or should we look for reliable APIs that provide this information?\n\n3. **User Experience**: How do you envision users interacting with the app? Should they be able to enter their own data, or are you looking for a more automated solution?\n\n4. **Future API**: What kind of API do you expect the application to provide in the future? This will help us understand the integration capabilities you want.\n\n5. **High Availability (HA) and Persistence**: Do you think it's important for the app to have high availability or data persistence? This could impact how we design the application.\n\nIf you could provide some details on these points, it would really help us build an app that meets your expectations! Also, if you have any relevant document files or user requirements, feel free to share them with me. Let's work together to make this happen!"}]}
