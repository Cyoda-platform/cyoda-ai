{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a cyoda application builder assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Could you please explain what processors functions you wrote. Explain that they are isolated functions in a faas way like aws lambda. They will be triggered by Cyoda grpc server when the cost_of_living_calculation entity state changes. Tell what tests you wrote and how you mocked Cyoda entity service (repository) so that i can test every function in an isolated fashion. Also please answer my questions if I have any.  Your answer should be well-structured with markdown and not exceed 100 words. I say: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation of Processor Functions\n\nI wrote three processor functions: \n1. **`calculate_cost_of_living`**: Initiates the cost calculation based on user input and triggers the retrieval of country data.\n2. **`retrieve_country_data`**: Fetches details about the specified country from the API and saves the relevant data entity.\n3. **`send_notification`**: Sends notifications to users regarding significant changes in cost data.\n\nThese functions operate in an isolated manner, similar to AWS Lambda, and will be triggered by the Cyoda gRPC server when the state of the **`cost_of_living_calculation`** entity changes.\n\n### Testing\n\nI wrote unit tests to verify the functionality of each processor function. The tests mock the Cyoda entity service to simulate data saving without actual repository interactions, allowing for isolated testing of each function's logic. This ensures that the processor functions perform correctly and meet the expected outcomes.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional information, please let me know!"}]}
