I got it that you want me to validate your requirement for the app that calculates the cost of living in different countries. You'd like me to create a detailed user requirement document that includes user stories, a journey diagram, and a sequence diagram. I'll make sure to use markdown with the mermaid dialect for the diagrams.\n\n### User Requirement Document\n\n#### User Requirement Summary\n\nThe user is developing an application to calculate the cost of living in different countries. This app will help users compare living expenses across various locations, providing valuable insights for those considering relocation or travel.\n\n#### User Stories\n\n1. **As a user,** I want to input the name of the country I am interested in, so that I can get the latest cost of living data for that country.\n2. **As a user,** I want to compare the cost of living between my current country and another country, so that I can make informed decisions about relocation.\n3. **As a user,** I want to view detailed breakdowns of costs, such as housing, groceries, and transportation, so that I can understand what factors are influencing the overall cost of living.\n4. **As a user,** I want to receive notifications if there are significant changes in the cost of living data for countries I am monitoring, so that I can stay updated.\n\n#### Journey Diagram\n\n```mermaid\njourney\n    title User Journey for Cost of Living App\n    section User Inputs Country\n      User inputs country name: 1: User\n      System fetches data: 5: System\n      System displays data: 5: System\n    section Compare Costs\n      User selects countries to compare: 2: User\n      System retrieves comparison data: 4: System\n      System displays comparison results: 4: System\n    section View Details\n      User requests detailed breakdown: 2: User\n      System provides detailed cost categories: 5: System\n```\n\n#### Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant App\n    participant DataSource\n    User->>App: Input country name\n    App->>DataSource: Fetch cost of living data\n    DataSource-->>App: Return data\n    App->>User: Display cost of living information\n    User->>App: Request comparison\n    App->>DataSource: Fetch comparison data\n    DataSource-->>App: Return comparison data\n    App->>User: Display comparison results\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Choice\n\nI've included these specific components because they comprehensively capture the essential aspects of your requirement:\n\n- **User Stories** help identify what users need from the app, ensuring we focus on delivering meaningful features.\n- The **Journey Diagram** visualizes the steps users take while interacting with the app, highlighting key interactions and processes.\n- The **Sequence Diagram** demonstrates the flow of information between the user, the app, and the data source, clarifying how the app operates behind the scenes.\n\nIf there are any changes you'd like or additional details, just let me know! I'm here to help you make this project a success."}]}
