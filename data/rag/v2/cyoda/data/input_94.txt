This API uses the `api_bp_authors_entity` blueprint for better organization and routing. It processes incoming JSON data, saves the authors entity using the `entity_service`, and returns the technical ID of the saved entity. This functionality is crucial for enabling the integration of author data into the system, aligning with the project requirements. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let me know!"}]}
