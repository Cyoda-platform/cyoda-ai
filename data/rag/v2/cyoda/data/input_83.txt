The application aims to provide users with a seamless experience in accessing details about authors and their related books. This PRD outlines the entities involved, workflows, and the overall architecture of the application.\n## Goals and Objectives\n- To develop an application that integrates with the Authors API to retrieve author details.\n- To enable users to manage their favorite books associated with specific authors.\n- To implement a robust event-driven architecture using Cyoda to ensure scalability and efficiency.\n## Key Features\n- **Data Retrieval**: The application will retrieve author records from the Authors API based on user requests.\n- **Management of Favorite Books**: Users will be able to view and manage their favorite books linked to the authors.\n- **Automated Workflows**: The event-driven architecture will automate the workflows necessary for data processing and retrieval.\n## Entities Overview\n### 1. Authors Entity\n- **Description**: Represents the authors retrieved from the Authors API.\n- **Example Data Model JSON**:\nentity_type: JOB\nentity_source: API_REQUEST\n- \n  ```json\n  {\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Book 1\",\n        \"description\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Book 2\",\n        \"description\": \"Ut enim ad minim veniam...\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n### 2. Favorite Books Entity\n- **Description**: Represents the user\\'s favorite books associated with specific authors.\n- **Example Data Model JSON**:\nentity_type: SECONDARY_DATA\nentity_source: ENTITY_EVENT\n ```json\n  {\n    \"favourite_books\": [\n      {\n        \"user_id\": 1,\n        \"book_id\": 2,\n        \"collection_of_favourite_books\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": 2,\n            \"title\": \"Book 2\",\n            \"description\": \"Ut enim ad minim veniam...\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"user_id\": 2,\n        \"book_id\": 1,\n        \"collection_of_favourite_books\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": 1,\n            \"title\": \"Book 1\",\n            \"description\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n## Entities Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Authors Entity] -->|retrieves| B[Favorite Books Entity]\n```\n## Workflows and Flowcharts\n### Workflow for the Authors Entity\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Initial State: Start of the process to retrieve authors.] -->|transition: retrieve_authors, processor: retrieve_authors_process| B[Processing State: Authors have been retrieved successfully.]\n  B -->|transition: process_authors, processor: process_authors_data| C[End State: Workflow processing is complete.]\n```\n## Conclusion\nThe PRD outlines the necessary components and workflows for the Cyoda-based authors app. By integrating with the Authors API and utilizing an event-driven architecture, the application aims to provide a user-friendly experience for managing author information and related favorite books. This document will serve as a guide for the development and implementation phases, ensuring that the project meets its objectives effectively.\n\""}]}
