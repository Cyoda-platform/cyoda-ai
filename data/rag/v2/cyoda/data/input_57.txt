The `fetch_data()` function makes an asynchronous GET request to retrieve the activities, handling any errors that may occur. \n\nThe `ingest_data()` function processes the fetched data, mapping it to the required entity structure without saving it to the repository.\n\n### Tests Added\nI created a unit test class `TestDataIngestion`, which includes a test to verify that the `ingest_data()` function accurately maps the raw data. The test checks the count and values of the mapped data, ensuring functionality works as intended. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional information, please let me know! \\ud83d\\ude0a"}]}
