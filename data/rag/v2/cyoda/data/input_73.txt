{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a cyoda application builder assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Could you please explain what processors functions you wrote. Explain that they are isolated functions in a faas way like aws lambda. They will be triggered by Cyoda grpc server when the data_ingestion_job entity state changes. Tell what tests you wrote and how you mocked Cyoda entity service (repository) so that i can test every function in an isolated fashion. Also please answer my questions if I have any.  Your answer should be well-structured with markdown and not exceed 100 words. I say: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I wrote the processor function **`process_user_request`**, designed to operate in an isolated manner, akin to AWS Lambda functions. These functions will be triggered by the Cyoda gRPC server when the state of the `data_ingestion_job` entity changes. The function ingests raw data based on user requests and saves it as `conversion_result_entity`.\n\nI also developed unit tests to ensure functionality, using mocks to simulate the Cyoda entity service, allowing for testing in isolation without dependencies on external services. This approach verifies that the function behaves as expected during the data ingestion process. If you have any questions or need further details, please let me know!"}]}
