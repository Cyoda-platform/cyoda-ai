{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a cyoda application builder assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Could you please explain what processors functions you wrote. Explain that they are isolated functions in a faas way like aws lambda. They will be triggered by Cyoda grpc server when the order_entity entity state changes. Tell what tests you wrote and how you mocked Cyoda entity service (repository) so that i can test every function in an isolated fashion. Also please answer my questions if I have any.  Your answer should be well-structured with markdown and not exceed 100 words. I say: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation of Processor Functions\n\nI implemented two processor functions: **`process_order`** and **`send_notification`**. These isolated functions operate in a serverless manner, similar to AWS Lambda, and are triggered by the Cyoda gRPC server when the `order_entity` entity's state changes. \n\n- **`process_order`** handles the order placement, saving the order entity.\n- **`send_notification`** sends a notification to the user about the order status, saving the notification entity.\n\n### Testing and Mocking\n\nI wrote unit tests to validate these functions, using mocks to simulate the Cyoda entity service. This allows testing of each function in isolation without relying on the actual repository, ensuring that the functionality works as expected.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know! \ud83d\ude0a"}]}
