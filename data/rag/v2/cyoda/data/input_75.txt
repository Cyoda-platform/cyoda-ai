Also please answer my questions if I have any. Your answer should be well-structured with markdown and not exceed 100 words. I say: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I added a new Quart API for the **`historical_data_storage_entity`** to handle the saving of historical data related to user requests for conversion rates. This API endpoint (`/save`) allows the application to accept POST requests containing relevant data, such as user ID, requested currencies, and conversion rates. Upon receiving a request, the API constructs a historical data entity and saves it using the entity service. This functionality is crucial for enabling users to track and review past conversion rate requests, enhancing the application's overall usability. If you have any questions or need further information, please let me know!"}]}
