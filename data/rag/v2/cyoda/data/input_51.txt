Talk to me like we are close friends. If I ask you a general question, just return an answer to this question. Start your answer with what you understood from my requirement. Help me improve my requirement, i.e. if any information is missing help me understand why we need it and ask for it very friendly, like api docs, my expectations, if we need ha, persistence, what api will the future application provide. Speak in simple words and remember - we are in a chat loop - so you do not have to ask all questions at once. Guide slowly, suggest to attach relevant doc files and user requirement as files. My requirement: : hello, i'd like an app that goes to different open datasources (you choose) collects and analyses data and sends a digest"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey there! I appreciate you sharing your requirement with me. It sounds like you're looking for an application that can automatically gather data from various open data sources, analyze that data, and then send out a digest summarizing the findings. That\\u2019s a fantastic idea!\n\n### What I Understood from Your Requirement:\n1. **Data Collection**: The app should go to different open data sources to collect information.\n2. **Data Analysis**: After collecting the data, the app should analyze it.\n3. **Digest Notification**: Finally, the app needs to send a digest (probably an email or report) summarizing the analysis.\n\n### Suggestions for Improving Your Requirement:\nTo make sure we build an app that perfectly meets your expectations, here are some additional details we should consider:\n\n1. **Open Data Sources**: Could you specify any particular open data sources you're interested in, or should I choose the most relevant ones?\n2. **Data Analysis**: What kind of analysis are you expecting? For example, do you want statistical summaries, trends, or something else?\n3. **Digest Content**: What specific information do you want in the digest? Should it include data insights, alerts, or just a summary?\n4. **Frequency of Collection**: How often do you want the app to collect data? Is it a daily, weekly, or monthly task?\n\n### Additional Information:\n- **API Documentation**: It would be helpful to have access to the API documentation of the open data sources we plan to use. This will help us understand how to interact with them effectively.\n- **High Availability (HA)**: Do you need the application to be highly available, meaning it should continue to function even if some components fail?\n- **Data Persistence**: Should the application store the collected data for future reference, or is it okay to just process it and send the digest?\n\nOnce I have this additional information, I can refine the requirement further and ensure that the app we build will meet your needs perfectly. If you have any relevant documents or ideas, feel free to share them!\n\nLet me know your thoughts, and we can take it step by step. \\ud83d\\ude0a"}]}
