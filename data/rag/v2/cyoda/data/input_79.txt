Also please answer my questions if I have any. Your answer should be well-structured with markdown and not exceed 100 words. I say: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I added a Quart API for the **`data_ingestion_job`** entity, specifically designed to handle the saving of data ingestion job details. This API endpoint (`/save`) processes POST requests containing information such as job ID, name, scheduled time, status, and metrics related to the job's execution. Upon receiving a request, the API constructs the data ingestion job entity and saves it using the entity service. This functionality is crucial for managing the workflow associated with data ingestion, ensuring that the application can efficiently process user requests for conversion rates. If you have any questions or need further information, please let me know!"}]}
