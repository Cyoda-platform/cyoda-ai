The application must encompass several key functionalities designed to streamline the data handling process. Below are the comprehensive details of the user requirements:\\n\\n### 1. Data Ingestion\\n- **Requirement**: The application should be capable of ingesting data from a specified data source.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The user has not specified the exact type of data source, indicating flexibility in the input options.\\n  - The application should support various types of data ingestion methods, including:\\n    - **External APIs**: Fetching data from online services that provide APIs for access.\\n    - **Databases**: Connecting to databases to pull data directly.\\n    - **User Submissions**: Allowing manual entry or uploads from users.\\n  - The data ingestion process needs to be automated and scheduled to run:\\n    - **Frequency**: Once a day.\\n    - **Timing**: At a specific predetermined time.\\n\\n### 2. Data Aggregation\\n- **Requirement**: Once the data is successfully ingested, the application must aggregate this data.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The aggregation process involves transforming the raw data into a summarized form.\\n  - This may include:\\n    - **Calculations**: Performing mathematical operations on the data.\\n    - **Grouping**: Organizing the data into categories based on defined parameters.\\n    - **Data Manipulation**: Utilizing various methods to extract meaningful insights from the ingested data.\\n\\n### 3. Report Generation\\n- **Requirement**: After the aggregation of data, the application should save the aggregated information into a report format.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The report must be structured and easily interpretable, suitable for sharing with stakeholders.\\n  - The output report should present the aggregated data clearly and concisely.\\n\\n### 4. Email Notification\\n- **Requirement**: Upon the successful generation of the report, the application must automatically send the report to the admin's email.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The email notification should include relevant information about the report.\\n  - Formatting of the email is important for ease of reading and comprehension.\\n\\n### 5. Scheduling Mechanism\\n- **Requirement**: The application should implement a scheduling mechanism to ensure that the data ingestion job runs reliably every day.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The user has not specified a particular technology for scheduling, which allows for flexibility in choosing the method for scheduling.\\n  - Possible solutions could include:\\n    - **Cron Jobs**: Utilizing UNIX-based scheduling tools.\\n    - **Built-in Scheduling Functionalities**: Leveraging features from the deployment platform.\\n    - **External Scheduling Services**: Using third-party services to manage job scheduling.\\n\\n### 6. Admin Interaction\\n- **Requirement**: The admin will be the primary recipient of the reports generated by the application.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The application must ensure that email notifications are sent without errors.\\n  - A notification mechanism should be in place to inform the admin in case of failures during:\\n    - Report generation.\\n    - Email dispatch.\\n\\n### Additional Considerations\\n- The user has not indicated specific technologies or tools for implementation, allowing for flexibility in choosing appropriate tech stacks.\\n- The design should maintain a clear audit trail:\\n  - This may involve logging actions taken during data ingestion, aggregation, and report generation for accountability and traceability.\\n- Error handling must be incorporated to manage potential failures during:\\n  - Data ingestion.\\n  - Report generation.\\n  - Email sending.\\n\\n### Overall Goal\\nThe primary goal of the application is to streamline data ingestion, aggregation, and reporting processes while providing timely notifications to the admin. This approach aims to enhance efficiency and promote a user-friendly experience, ultimately supporting stakeholders with actionable insights derived from the data.\"}] .
