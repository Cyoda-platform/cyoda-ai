## Summary of User Requirement

The user has expressed a need to develop an application that focuses on data processing with the following detailed requirements:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - The application should be capable of ingesting data from a specified data source. While the user has not specified the exact source, it should support various types of input, such as external APIs, databases, or user submissions.
   - This data ingestion process should be automated and scheduled to run **once a day** at a specific time.

2. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Once the data is ingested, the application must aggregate this data. This means transforming the raw data into a summarized form, which may involve calculations, grouping, or other forms of data manipulation to produce meaningful insights.

3. **Report Generation**:
   - After aggregating the data, the application is required to save the aggregated information into a report format. This report should be structured and easily interpretable, as it will be shared with stakeholders.

4. **Email Notification**:
   - Upon the successful generation of the report, the application must automatically send the report to the admin's email. The email should include relevant information about the report and be formatted appropriately for easy reading.

5. **Scheduling Mechanism**:
   - The application should implement a scheduling mechanism to ensure the data ingestion job runs reliably every day. While the user has not specified the technology for scheduling, it could involve cron jobs, built-in scheduling functionalities, or external scheduling services.

6. **Admin Interaction**:
   - The admin will be the primary recipient of the reports generated by the application. The application should not only send the reports but also ensure that the email is sent without errors, providing a notification mechanism in case of failures.

### Additional Considerations:
- The user did not mention specific technologies or tools, allowing flexibility in choosing the appropriate stacks for implementation.
- The design should maintain a clear audit trail, possibly by logging the actions taken during data ingestion, aggregation, and report generation for accountability and traceability.
- Error handling should be incorporated to manage failures during data ingestion, report generation, or email sending.

The overall goal of the application is to streamline the process of data ingestion, aggregation, and reporting while ensuring timely notifications to the admin, thus providing an efficient and user-friendly experience.
