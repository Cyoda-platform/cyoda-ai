application focusing on efficient data processing. The application must encompass several key functionalities, which are outlined below:\\n\\n### 1. Data Ingestion\\n- **Requirement**: The application should be capable of ingesting data from a specified data source.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - While the user has not specified the exact source, the application should support various types of input, including external APIs, databases, or user submissions.\\n  - The data ingestion process needs to be automated and scheduled to run **once a day** at a specific time.\\n  \\n### 2. Data Aggregation\\n- **Requirement**: Once the data is ingested, the application must aggregate this data.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The aggregation process involves transforming the raw data into a summarized form.\\n  - This may include calculations, grouping, or other forms of data manipulation to extract meaningful insights from the ingested data.\\n\\n### 3. Report Generation\\n- **Requirement**: After the aggregation of data, the application should save the aggregated information into a report format.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The report must be structured and easily interpretable, as it is intended to be shared with stakeholders.\\n  \\n### 4. Email Notification\\n- **Requirement**: Upon the successful generation of the report, the application must automatically send the report to the admin's email.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The email notification should include relevant information about the report and be formatted appropriately for easy reading.\\n  \\n### 5. Scheduling Mechanism\\n- **Requirement**: The application should implement a scheduling mechanism to ensure that the data ingestion job runs reliably every day.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - While the user has not specified the technology for scheduling, it could involve cron jobs, built-in scheduling functionalities, or external scheduling services to manage the timing of the data ingestion process.\\n\\n### 6. Admin Interaction\\n- **Requirement**: The admin will be the primary recipient of the reports generated by the application.\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The application should not only send reports but also ensure that the email is sent without errors.\\n  - There must be a notification mechanism in place to inform the admin in case of failures during the report generation or email dispatch.\\n\\n### Additional Considerations\\n- The user has not indicated specific technologies or tools for implementation, allowing for flexibility in choosing appropriate stacks.\\n- The design should maintain a clear audit trail:\\n  - This may involve logging actions taken during data ingestion, aggregation, and report generation for accountability and traceability.\\n- Error handling must be incorporated to manage potential failures during data ingestion, report generation, or email sending.\\n\\n### Overall Goal\\nThe overall goal of the application is to streamline data ingestion, aggregation, and reporting processes while providing timely notifications to the admin. This will enhance efficiency and offer a user-friendly experience, ultimately supporting stakeholders with actionable insights derived from the data.\"}] .
