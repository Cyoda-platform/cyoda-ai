Below are the comprehensive details of the user\\u2019s requirements:\\n\\n### 1. Data Retrieval\\n- **Requirement**: The application should be able to retrieve inventory data using the SwaggerHub API.\\n- **API Endpoint**: The specific endpoint for retrieving inventory items is located at [SwaggerHub API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/CGIANNAROS/Test/1.0.0#/developers/searchInventory).\\n- **Capabilities**:\\n  - The API should provide a method to either retrieve all inventory items or filter them based on specific criteria.\\n  - The application must handle various data fields returned by the API to ensure that relevant information can be extracted.\\n\\n### 2. Report Generation\\n- **Requirement**: After retrieving the inventory data, the application should generate reports that summarize key metrics.\\n- **Key Metrics to Include**:\\n  - Total number of items in the inventory.\\n  - Average price of the inventory items.\\n  - Total value of the inventory.\\n  - Potentially other statistics depending on the fields available from the API response.\\n  \\n### 3. Data Presentation\\n- **Requirement**: The reports generated should be presented in a user-friendly format.\\n- **Presentation Options**:\\n  - The application could display the report in a table format for easy reading.\\n  - Charts and visual representations may also be considered to enhance data comprehension.\\n\\n### 4. Error Handling\\n- **Requirement**: The application must incorporate error handling mechanisms.\\n- **Error Handling Capabilities**:\\n  - The application should handle errors during data retrieval from the API.\\n  - It should also manage any issues that arise during report generation.\\n  - Users should be informed of any errors encountered clearly and concisely.\\n\\n### 5. User Experience\\n- **Requirement**: The overall user experience must be smooth and intuitive.\\n- **User Interaction**:\\n  - Users should be able to trigger the report generation process without extensive technical knowledge.\\n  - The application should provide clear feedback on the success or failure of operations.\\n\\n### Additional Considerations\\n- The user has emphasized the importance of presenting data clearly and ensuring that any error messages are actionable and informative for the end-user.\\n- The application should be designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the potential addition of more features and metrics in the future.\\n\\n### Overall Goal\\nThe primary goal of the application is to streamline the entire process of data retrieval, report generation, and data presentation, ultimately providing stakeholders with actionable insights derived from the inventory data. This workflow should enable efficient decision-making regarding inventory management and evaluation.\"}] . Do not do any mapping logic - it is not relevant.
