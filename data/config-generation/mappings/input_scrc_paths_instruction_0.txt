#inputSrcPaths
As for inputSrcPaths you should list all paths of input parameters that are used. Also take into account that cyoda inputSrcPaths use a different json path.
#inputSrcPaths for nested objects:
If for example there is input {"purchaser": {"name":"Jim"}} then the inputSrcPaths will be "purchaser/name" and NOT "purchaser.name".
For arrays use wildcrds like notices/*/data.

###inputSrcPaths for nested objects. The correct format for inputSrcPaths for nested objects should be "parentObject/childObject/attribute".
For example, if we have an input object like this:

```json

{
  "purchaser": {
    "name": "ABC Corporation"
  }
}

```
The inputSrcPath for the "name" attribute of the "purchaser" object would be "purchaser/name".

There can be variations in the input and the entity. Just try to find any relations and map them with a script.
