#Connections
This is instruction on how to write/produce/generate connections endpoint json objects.

Connection json objects are a json representation of external APIs.
APIs can be submitted in Open API format or in arbitary format. Do your best to analyse the requirement.
Let's take an examle.
This is a API Documentation for Cats API. 

Input:
## cats api start
API Documentation
Base URL for all endpoints https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com

The response time will likely be a few seconds long on the first request, because this app is running on a free Heroku dyno. Subsequent requests will behave as normal.

Endpoints
/facts Retrieve and query facts

Models
Fact An animal fact

User A user of the Cat Facts site
## cats api ends

Based on this document let's produce connection json objects.

First, let's get the endpoint. From the document we know that there is one endpoint "/facts". Its URL is  https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com , path = /facts and method is GET as nothing else specified.

So, we can generate the following connection object.

Expected endpoint output: 
```JSON
        {
            "operation": "facts",
            "query": "/facts",
            "method": "GET",
            "parameters": [],
            "bodyTemplate": "",
            "connectionTimeout": 300,
            "readWriteTimeout": 300
        }
```
