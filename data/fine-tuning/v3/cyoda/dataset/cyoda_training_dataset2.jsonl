(RAW_DATA)\n\nDescription: Store unprocessed data obtained from various inputs (e.g., external APIs, user submissions, or web scraping).\nLifecycle in Workflow: Creation or updates to these entities trigger the associated JOB workflows to ingest and process this data.\nDerived Data Entities (SECONDARY_DATA)\n\nDescription: Contain transformed or enriched data derived from RAW_DATA through JOB workflows. They often have different schemas or structures than the original RAW_DATA.\nLifecycle in Workflow: Serve as intermediate outputs from workflows. Changes in SECONDARY_DATA can trigger further processing steps such as enrichment, aggregation, and eventually reporting.\nJob Entities (JOB)\n\nDescription: Represent the execution of processes rather than data. They initiate and manage workflows that act on RAW_DATA and produce SECONDARY_DATA.\nLifecycle in Workflow: Triggered by API calls, schedules, or entity events, JOB entities orchestrate the ingestion, transformation, enrichment, aggregation, and reporting processes.\nWorkflows as State Machines:\n\nStates: Each entity\u2019s status at a given time is captured as a \u201cstate,\u201d reflecting its current stage in the workflow.\nTransitions: Define how an entity moves from one state to another. In JOB workflows, transitions like ingest_data, transform_data, enrich_data, and aggregate_data are automated steps that run when conditions are met. Others, like add_report, may require manual triggers or additional data.\nTypes of Transitions:\n\nAutomatic Transitions: Execute when the required conditions are fulfilled without any external input, advancing the entity\u2019s state automatically.\nManual Transitions: Require user intervention or an external call to proceed.\nProcesses and Server-Side Functions:\n\nProcesses: Attached to transitions, these represent the logic performed during the state change. For example, transform_data() is a process that uses entity_service functions to manipulate data.\n\nServer-Side Functions:\n\nProvisioning: Developers provide functions that implement the logic referenced by transitions. Each function\u2019s name should match the process name and must be in Python.\nExecution: Functions run in a stateless environment. They receive metadata and entity data as arguments and can update entities, fetch additional data, and store results.\nSide Effects: Updated entities are persisted and subsequently used in downstream transitions.\nEvent-Driven Architecture:\n\nEvent Emission: Events occur when entities are created, modified, or removed.\nEvent Handling: These events trigger or advance workflows, moving entities through their defined transitions.\nWorkflow Persistence and Recovery:\n\nPersisting state within each entity allows for:\nScalability: Distributing workload across multiple instances.\nAuditability: Keeping a historical record of transitions for review and debugging.\n\n\n Required Output:\n\n Provide a Cyoda design JSON in the following format:\n\n json\n\n{\n  \"can_proceed\": false,\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\n      \"depends_on_entity\": \"None\",\n      \"entity_name\": \"data_ingestion_job\",\n      \"entity_source\": \"SCHEDULED\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"JOB\",\n      \"entity_workflow\": {\n        \"class_name\": \"com.cyoda.tdb.model.treenode.TreeNodeEntity\",\n        \"name\": \"data_ingestion_workflow\",\n        \"transitions\": [\n          {\n            \"criteria\": {\n              \"description\": \"Triggered by a scheduled job to ingest data.\",\n              \"name\": \"scheduled_ingestion\"\n            },\n            \"description\": \"Start the data ingestion process from the API.\",\n            \"end_state\": \"data_ingested\",\n            \"end_state_description\": \"Data has been successfully ingested.\",\n            \"name\": \"start_data_ingestion\",\n            \"process\": {\n              \"adds_new_entites\": \"raw_data_entity\",\n              \"description\": \"Process to ingest raw data from the specified API.\",\n              \"name\": \"ingest_raw_data\"\n            },\n            \"start_state\": \"None\",\n            \"start_state_description\": \"Initial state before data ingestion.\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"depends_on_entity\": \"data_ingestion_job\",\n      \"entity_name\": \"raw_data_entity\",\n      \"entity_source\": \"ENTITY_EVENT\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"EXTERNAL_SOURCES_PULL_BASED_RAW_DATA\",\n      \"entity_workflow\": {\n        \"name\": \"raw_data_entity_workflow\",\n        \"class_name\": \"com.cyoda.tdb.model.treenode.TreeNodeEntity\",\n        \"transitions\": []\n      }\n      }\n      //other entities,\n  //entities names, processor names - should be all lowercase and underscore in order to match python style\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nFor error 'None' is not of type 'object' use {} instead or for workflow \"entity_workflow\": {\n        \"name\": \"entity_workflow\",\n        \"class_name\": \"com.cyoda.tdb.model.treenode.TreeNodeEntity\",\n        \"transitions\": []\n      }\nRead this instruction, tell that you read it and wait for new instructions\n\nExample of server-side function file:\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\n\nfrom common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION\nfrom app_init.app_init import entity_service\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nasync def process_name(meta, data):\n    entity = await entity_service.get_item(meta[\"token\"], \"order\", ENTITY_VERSION, data[\"id\"])\n    logger.info(\"processing \")\n\n```",

Start your answer with what you understood from my requirement. Help me improve my requirement, i.e. if any information is missing help me understand why we need it and ask for it very friendly, like api docs, my expectations, if we need ha, persistence, what api will the future application provide. Speak in simple words and remember - we are in a chat loop - so you do not have to ask all questions at once. Guide slowly, suggest to attach relevant doc files and user requirement as files. My requirement: : Hello! I need an application to generate reports on inventory data using the SwaggerHub API at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/CGIANNAROS/Test/1.0.0#/developers/searchInventory.  Assuming the API provides a way to retrieve all inventory items or to filter them, the application should be able to generate reports summarizing key metrics like the total number of items, average price, total value, and potentially other statistics, depending on the available data fields.  These reports should be displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., table, chart). Error handling and clear presentation of data are crucial",
        "answer": "I understand that you're looking to build an application that generates reports based on inventory data sourced from the SwaggerHub API. You want it to summarize key metrics, such as the total number of items, average price, and total value, while presenting this information in a clear and user-friendly format like tables or charts. You've highlighted the importance of error handling and data presentation.\n\nTo help improve your requirement, let's clarify a few things:\n\n1. **API Documentation**: It would be super helpful to have detailed API documentation. You mentioned the SwaggerHub API; do you have any specific expectations on how you'd like the API to behave? For instance, what data fields should we focus on for the reports? Understanding this will help us define the data structure better.\n\n2. **User Expectations**: What exactly do you want the end-user to be able to do? For example, should they be able to filter the reports by certain criteria or maybe download them in different formats? Knowing this will ensure we design a user-friendly interface that meets their needs.\n\n3. **High Availability (HA)**: Are you expecting the application to be highly available? If so, we'd need to consider how to handle potential downtimes and server failures.\n\n4. **Persistence**: Do you need to store the generated reports for future access? If yes, we should think about how and where to store this data.\n\n5. **Future APIs**: Do you have any plans for additional APIs that the application should support later on? It might influence how we structure the application now.\n\nOnce we have this information, it'll make it easier to outline the project effectively. And if you have any documents or additional requirements, feel free to share them! They can help paint a clearer picture for us. What do you think?"

Entity: Inventory Data\n- **Description**: Stores raw inventory data retrieved from the SwaggerHub API.\n- **Save Method**: Directly via an API call.\n  \n**Example JSON Data Model**:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"name\": \"Widget Adapter\",\n  \"release_date\": \"2016-08-29T09:12:33.001Z\",\n  \"manufacturer\": {\n    \"name\": \"ACME Corporation\",\n    \"home_page\": \"https://www.acme-corp.com\",\n    \"phone\": \"408-867-5309\"\n  },\n  \"quantity_available\": 75,\n  \"price\": 29.99\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Entity: Raw Inventory Data\n- **Description**: Represents unprocessed data retrieved from the API.\n- **Save Method**: Through the workflow of the Inventory Data entity (trigger an ENTITY_EVENT).\n\n**Example JSON Data Model**:\n```json\n{\n  \"raw_id\": \"raw_001\",\n  \"inventory_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2023-10-02T05:00:00Z\",\n  \"raw_data\": {...}\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Entity: Report\n- **Description**: Represents generated reports summarizing key metrics.\n- **Save Method**: Through a workflow that triggers after processing the Raw Inventory Data (trigger an ENTITY_EVENT).\n\n**Example JSON Data Model**:\n```json\n{\n  \"report_id\": \"report_2023_10_02\",\n  \"generated_at\": \"2023-10-02T05:15:00Z\",\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"total_items\": 150,\n    \"average_price\": 29.99,\n    \"total_value\": 4498.5\n  },\n  \"summary\": \"This report summarizes the inventory data processed for the day.\"\n}\n```\n\n## Workflows Overview\n\n### Workflow for Inventory Data Entity\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start State] -->|transition: request_data, processor: fetch_inventory_data| B[Data Fetched]\n  B -->|transition: save_raw_data, processor: save_inventory_data| C[Raw Data Saved]\n  C --> D[End State]\n```\n\n### Workflow for Raw Inventory Data Entity\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start State] -->|transition: process_raw_data, processor: generate_report| B[Data Processed]\n  B -->|transition: save_report, processor: save_report| C[Report Generated]\n  C --> D[End State]\n```\n\n## User Journey\n\n```mermaid\njourney\n    title User Journey for Inventory Reporting\n    section Retrieving Inventory Data\n      User initiates data retrieval: 5: User\n      API returns inventory data: 5: API\n    section Generating Reports\n      User requests report generation: 5: User\n      System processes data and generates metrics: 5: System\n      System presents report in user-friendly format: 5: System\n    section Error Handling\n      If data retrieval fails, user receives error: 5: System\n```\n\n## Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant API\n    participant ReportGenerator\n    participant ReportDisplay\n\n    User->>API: Request inventory data\n    API-->>User: Return inventory data\n    User->>ReportGenerator: Request report generation\n    ReportGenerator->>ReportGenerator: Calculate metrics (total items, average price, total value)\n    ReportGenerator-->>ReportDisplay: Send report data\n    ReportDisplay-->>User: Display report\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Inventory Reporting Application will effectively meet the user requirements outlined in this document. By utilizing the SwaggerHub API for data retrieval and implementing well-defined workflows, the application will facilitate the generation of insightful reports while ensuring a user-friendly experience.\n\n---\n\nHow does this PRD look to you?

If the request is successful (HTTP status 200), it returns the JSON response. If there\u2019s an error, it logs the error message.\n\n2. **ingest_data() Function**: This public function retrieves the data using `fetch_data`. If data is received, it maps the raw data to the specified entity structure, renaming fields as necessary. Finally, it returns the mapped data.\n\n3. **Unit Test Class**: The `TestDataIngestion` class uses the `unittest` framework to test the `ingest_data` function. The `test_ingest_data_success` method runs the function and verifies that the data is mapped correctly.\n\n4. **Execution**: When you run the script, it will execute the unit tests to validate the functionality of the `ingest_data` function.\n\nFeel free to run this code in your environment to test the functionality!
