    "# AI Cyoda configurations Q&A with RAG Langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook! This notebook serves as your guide to developing an AI-powered Question & Answer system using the Langchain library. This system utilizes the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, a powerful tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this notebook is to generate Cyoda mapping configurations and resources. It does so by interacting with the data set available in the official Cyoda repository. By following along, you'll learn how to harness the power of Langchain and RAG to create a sophisticated AI tool for Cyoda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will we cover?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up the environment**: We will install necessary libraries and load environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initializing the AI model**: We will initialize the ChatOpenAI model with the appropriate parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loading instructions and entities**: We will load instructions and entities from the official repository using the GitLoader.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Splitting documents and creating a vectorstore**: We will split the loaded documents into chunks and create a vectorstore using the Chroma library.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Defining prompts for contextualizing and answering questions**: We will define prompts that the AI model will use to contextualize and answer questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Creating a retrieval chain**: We will create a retrieval chain that combines the history-aware retriever and the question-answer chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Running the chatbot**: Finally, we will run the chatbot and see it in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow along with the code cells and comments to understand each step of the process. If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to ask for help. Happy coding!"
